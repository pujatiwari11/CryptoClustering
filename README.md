# CryptoClustering

Used Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Result
The elbow curves show similar results, but the inertia for PCA data is lower than for K-means data. The K-means cluster plot has significantly fewer markers than the PCA data. In the original data, the best k value is 4, but when observing the PCA data, it appears likely to be 2 because the two groups of clusters (yellow and blue) are closer together and easier to identify, while there's only one marker for the green and red cluster (both are also outliers). The K-means plot is difficult to read due to dispersed clusters, but the PCA cluster analysis is more accurate based on the elbow and scatter plots.
